# Simple Interest Project


This project calculates simple interest using a shell script.  
It is a basic example to demonstrate GitHub workflows and collaboration using standard repository files.


## How It Works
The formula used is:



Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Run the `simple-interest.sh` script and follow the prompts.
